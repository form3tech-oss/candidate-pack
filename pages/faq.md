## Our Engineering Team

**How many engineers are there at Form3?**

As of May 2021, we have 110 engineers based in 21 different countries across the EU. We continue to add several new engineers every month.

**How is the team structured?**

We've many small teams of 4-8 people who own a product end-to-end. Each team consists of software engineers and business analysts, as well as an engineering lead and a product manager. As we grow we'll create more teams, but will always look to keep them small and focused.

**What are the career progression pathways for a software engineer at Form3?**

Every engineer has the chance to work on a variety of technologies and products, across different areas of the business. As we grow we'll further expand our product offering, whilst also seeing the number of transactions and the amount of data we process increase significantly. If technical and people leadership is of interest to you, there will be opportunity for you to step up and take on these challenges as well.

**What is the turnover within the engineering team?**

The turnover within our team is really low, currently sitting at just 8%. 

## Interview Process

**Iâ€™ve not worked with Go before, should I still apply?**

Definitely! Approximately a third of the engineers we have hired in the last 12 months had not worked with Go prior to joining Form3. That being said, we do ask candidates to attempt a technical exercise in Go, however experience with the language is considered when we are reviewing it.

**What does the interview process look like?**

Once you have applied a member of our Talent Team will be in touch to arrange a 30-45 minutes telephone call to introduce Form3 and talk through your experience in a bit more detail.

You will then be sent information about a take home exercise that we ask all candidates to attempt in Go. We really want to see an example of your best work and a lot of the candidates that we speak with have not worked with Go before, therefore we decided not to set a time limit or deadline. Take as long as you need to put together a project that you are proud of.

If feedback on your take home exercise is positive, we move straight to final stage technical interview via video-link. This is a 90-minute interview where you will meet with 3 members of our engineering team on a one-to-one basis for 30 minutes each.

**How long does the interview process take?**
It really depends on how quickly you are able to complete the take home exercise, but on average our interview process takes about 2 weeks from initial application to offer, although we can move faster on this, if required.

**Do I receive feedback on my technical exercise if unsuccessful?**

Yes. Each technical exercise is reviewed by two engineers and they will provide written feedback that highlights the positive aspects of your solution, whilst explaining areas that could have been improved.
