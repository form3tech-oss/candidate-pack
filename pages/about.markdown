# Our Story

Launched in 2016 by payment geeks, we have gone from start-up to established scale-up at a sensational pace. We are now a team of close to 250 amazing people and proudly partner with some of the most exciting and disruptive banks and FinTech’s in the world. We’ve rolled out into Europe and have ambitious plans to expand internationally. We are massively excited about our journey - and it’s only the beginning!

# Our love for technology

Though dotted across the UK and Europe, our love for cloud-native technology is what unites us. Technical excellence is our passion and we delight in using technology to continually improve our customer’s experience. When you combine that with operational excellence, magic happens.

# Driven by our Values

These are the things we believe in; they guide our decisions and our actions

# A remote-first culture

We are a remote-first team collaborating across 21 countries, representing over 50 nationalities. We let people work from wherever they are happiest and most productive (whether that is in an office or from a hammock in their garden). It’s also great for diversity. Attracting the best people for our team means looking for talent in different places. We work hard to make sure we don’t lose the human connection and that our people are given the trust, freedom and tools to work to the best of their ability. Our engineering team is 100% remote and our other teams have significant remote working opportunities as well. Working remotely may not be your cup of tea and there is still value in face-to-face interaction so if you prefer working in the office or want to see your colleagues in person, we’ve got you covered. You can drop into our London and Amsterdam offices as much as you want. You’re always more than welcome.

# The Team

Our software engineers work in small, highly agile, self-managed teams. Individually, they are all exceptional at what they do – together, they build world-class software for our customers. We share a common interest in engineering best practices and understand that quality is everyone's responsibility. Our philosophy is to favour collaborative development practices where we leverage open source tools and communities, always making sure to share our know-how back up stream. Put simply, we are cloud-native enthusiasts and DevOps advocates.
